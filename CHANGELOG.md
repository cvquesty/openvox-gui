## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-12

### Highlights
First stable release of OpenVox GUI. All core features are complete, tested, and production-ready.

### New Features
- **Settings > Services Tab**: New dedicated Services tab in the Settings page with full ecosystem service management -- shows live status, PID, uptime, and individual restart buttons for PuppetServer, PuppetDB, Puppet agent, and the OpenVox GUI application itself
- **Dynamic Application Name**: The configured "Application Name" setting now dynamically updates the browser tab title, the login page title, and the app header -- changes take effect immediately on next page load
- **Clickable Logo and Title**: Clicking the OpenVox logo or application title in the header navigates back to the Dashboard
- **Service Restart Link**: The "service restart" text in the Application Settings instructions is now an active link that switches directly to the Services tab
- **Public App Name Endpoint**: New unauthenticated `GET /api/config/app/name` endpoint so the login page can display the configured app name before authentication

### Improvements
- **Code Deployment Restart Button**: Replaced the full services panel (individual service cards) with a single "Restart All Puppet Services" button that restarts PuppetDB, PuppetServer, and Puppet agent in the correct dependency order via `POST /api/config/services/restart-puppet-stack`
- **Node Classifier Tab Order**: Nodes tab is now the default/first tab; Hierarchy tab renamed to "Help" and moved to last position
- **Node Classifier Groups Dropdown**: The groups MultiSelect when classifying a node now shows ALL configured groups organized by environment as option groups, instead of filtering to only the selected environment (which hid groups in other environments)
- **Orchestration Format Isolation**: Switching output format (Human/JSON/Rainbow) in Run Command, Run Task, or Run Plan now clears the previous result to prevent stale output from a different format being displayed
- **Bolt Version Display**: Fixed the Orchestration Overview tab showing "unknown" for the Bolt version; the status endpoint now calls `bolt --version` directly without appending inventory flags
- **Save Notification**: Updated setting save notification to say "Go to the Services tab to restart" with clear guidance

### Bug Fixes
- **ENC Greenlet Error**: Fixed `greenlet_spawn has not been called` SQLAlchemy async error when classifying nodes -- root cause was lazy-loaded relationships on the `EncNode.groups` many-to-many; fixed by adding `lazy="selectin"` to both sides of the relationship and replacing `db.refresh(node)` with a proper re-fetch using `selectinload`
- **Bolt Version Endpoint**: `bolt --version` was routed through `run_bolt_command()` which appends `-i inventory.yaml`, causing the command to fail silently

### API Endpoints Added
- `GET /api/config/app/name` -- Public (no auth) endpoint returning the configured application name
- `POST /api/config/services/restart-puppet-stack` -- Ordered restart of PuppetDB, PuppetServer, Puppet agent

### Installer
- Version bumped to v1.0.0
- Added `openvox-gui` service restart permission to sudoers
- Added `puppetserver ca` and `openssl x509` sudoers rules
- Added `/opt/openvox-gui/config` to systemd `ReadWritePaths` for settings persistence

## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-11

### Bug Fixes
- **Fact Explorer**: Rewrote page to use dedicated REST endpoints (`/api/facts/names`, `/api/facts/values/{name}`) instead of broken PQL queries; dropdown now loads all 125+ fact names and displays certname + value table for the fleet
- **Code Deployment**: Fixed crash ("Table is not defined") caused by missing `Table` import from Mantine
- **Application Settings 500 Error**: Fixed "Read-only file system" crash when updating settings; added `/opt/openvox-gui/config` to systemd `ReadWritePaths`

### Improvements
- **Orchestration Output Format Selector**: Run Command, Run Task, and Run Plan tabs now include a segmented control to choose output format: Human (clean text), JSON (structured data), or Rainbow (full ANSI color). Rainbow output renders with proper terminal colors in the browser via `ansi-to-html`
- **Orchestration PTY Support**: Rainbow format uses `script(1)` to allocate a pseudo-TTY so Bolt emits full RGB ANSI color sequences; `--color` flag is appended automatically
- **Bolt Inventory Flag**: All Bolt commands now include `-i /etc/puppetlabs/bolt/inventory.yaml` automatically so the inventory file is always found
- **PQL Console Certname Dropdown**: Added a searchable node selector that auto-substitutes `NODENAME` placeholders in example queries with the selected certname
- **Settings Nav Rename**: Renamed "Application" sidebar link to "Settings" with a gear icon for clarity
- **PQL Console Unlimited Results**: Default query limit raised from 100 to 10,000; results pane uses viewport-height scrolling (`calc(100vh - 200px)`) instead of a fixed 500px cap

### API Endpoints Added
- `GET /api/facts/names` — List all known fact names from PuppetDB
- `GET /api/facts/values/{fact_name}` — Get certname + value for every node with the given fact

### Dependencies
- Added `ansi-to-html` npm package for ANSI escape code rendering in Orchestration results


## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-11

### Major Features
- **PQL Query Console** — Execute ad-hoc Puppet Query Language queries directly against PuppetDB with example library, auto-detected column rendering, and query history
- **Certificate Authority Management** — Sign, revoke, and clean Puppet CA certificates with detailed certificate inspection via `puppetserver ca`
- **Fact Explorer** — Search and compare any fact across the entire fleet with value distribution analysis and filtering
- **Resource Explorer** — Search Puppet resources (Package, Service, File, Class, etc.) across all nodes with regex title filtering
- **Deploy History** — Persistent deployment log tracking who deployed, when, what environment, and success/failure status

### Improvements
- **React Error Boundary** — Component crashes now show a friendly error message with stack trace and recovery options instead of a blank white page
- **Dashboard Auto-Refresh** — Configurable live polling (10s/30s/1m/5m) with "Live" indicator badge and last-updated timestamp
- **Code Splitting** — All pages are lazy-loaded via React.lazy/Suspense; initial bundle reduced significantly
- **Sidebar Navigation** — Added missing "Nodes" link; new sections for PuppetDB Explorer (PQL Console, Fact Explorer, Resource Explorer) and Infrastructure (Certificates)
- **Run Puppet Button** — Node detail page now has a "Run Puppet" button that triggers `puppet_agent::run` via Bolt
- **Version 0.3.0** — Major version bump reflecting the scope of new features

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed missing `json` import in config.py router that would crash preferences API

- **Preferences API** (`/api/config/preferences`): GET/PUT endpoint for persisting theme and future user preferences to `preferences.json`
- **Settings update API** (`PUT /api/config/app`): Endpoint to update individual `.env` settings by key/value pair

### Changed
- **AppShell**: Header, navbar, and logo dynamically adapt to active theme — white header and light gray navbar (`#f8f9fa`) in Formal mode
- **Login page**: Background gradient, logo, and sign-in button color adapt to active theme
- **MantineProvider**: Dynamically switches between dark/light color scheme and orange/blue primary palette based on theme

---

## [0.2.39] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **Create Group blank screen crash**: Mantine v7 grouped MultiSelect requires data in `[{group, items: [{value, label}]}]` format — was incorrectly using Mantine v6 format `[{value, label, group}]` which caused the component to crash silently on render

---

## [0.2.38] - 2026-02-09

### Added
- **Available Classes API** (`GET /api/enc/available-classes`): Scans Puppet module manifests from `modules/`, `site-modules/`, and `site/` directories and returns all discovered class names organized by module

---

## [0.2.36] - 2026-02-09

### Changed
- **Node Classifier**: Complete architectural redesign from flat ENC to hierarchical 4-layer deep merge model
  - **Common layer**: Global defaults applied to all nodes (lowest priority)
  - **Environment layer**: Per-environment classes and parameters
  - **Group layer**: Reusable groups of classifications
  - **Node layer**: Per-node overrides (highest priority)
  - Classification resolution uses deep merge: Common → Environment → Group → Node

  - Hierarchy (overview with merge order visualization)
  - Common (global defaults)
  - Environments (per-environment classification)
  - Node Groups (reusable groups)
  - Nodes (per-node overrides)
  - Classification Lookup (deep-merged YAML output for any node)
- **ENC API endpoints**: New hierarchical endpoints replacing flat classification model:
  - `GET/POST /api/enc/common` — global common layer

---

## [0.2.34] - 2026-02-09

### Changed
- **Application page**: Converted to tabbed layout with "Application Settings" and "User Manager" tabs
- **User Manager**: Moved from standalone page under "Administration" nav group into the Application page as a tab — authentication panel moved to top of User Manager tab

- "Administration" navigation group

---

---

## [0.2.19] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- **User Manager illustration**: Animated SVG "People Processing Machine" (USER-O-MATIC 3000) showing confused stick figures entering a conveyor belt machine with spinning gears, status lights, and a smokestack, then emerging as properly badged and sorted users (Admin with crown, Operator with wrench, Viewer with glasses). Caption: "unsorted humans in → properly badged users out (no humans were harmed in the making of this feature)"

---

## [0.2.18] - 2026-02-10

### Changed

  - **Deploying**: Robot raises arm and fires laser at city, red eyes flash rapidly, sky turns red, explosion with smoke and debris, caption reads "r10k deployment in progress... / destroying legacy environments since 2014"
- **Output window**: Doubled in height (400px scrollable area); full scrollback preserved across multiple deployments with timestamped headers; auto-scrolls to bottom on new output; "Clear" button to reset
- **Output accumulation**: Each deploy appends to the log with a separator banner showing timestamp and environment, rather than replacing previous output

---

## [0.2.16] - 2026-02-10

### Changed
- **Code Deployment page**: Completely redesigned layout
  - "Deploy with r10k" panel moved to top-left half with environment selector and deploy button

---

## [0.2.14] - 2026-02-10

### Changed
- **Active Users**: Moved from Dashboard stats row to the navigation sidebar — displayed as a small text line under the version number (e.g. "2 active users"), with a hover popover showing each user's name and IP
- **Active sessions polling**: The sidebar now polls `/api/dashboard/active-sessions` every 30 seconds to keep the count current across all pages

### Removed
- **Dashboard stats cards**: Removed the Total Nodes, Unchanged, Changed, Failed, Noop, and Active Users cards — this data was redundant with the Node Status donut chart already shown below
- **StatsCard component**: No longer used, removed from Dashboard

---

- **Logo**: Reverted to the original unmodified OpenVox logo from [voxpupuli/logos](https://github.com/voxpupuli/logos/blob/master/images/OpenVox/Black/original_files_by_smortex/logo.svg) — both the header and login page now use the same original SVG

### Removed
- **`openvox-logo-white.svg`**: Deleted the color-swapped variant; only the original `openvox-logo.svg` is used

---

## [0.2.11] - 2026-02-10

### Changed
- **Active Users card**: Now displays a hover dropdown when moused over — shows each active user's name, IP address, and time since last seen (e.g. "3m ago"), while the card itself remains the same compact size as the other stats cards showing just the count and icon

---

## [0.2.10] - 2026-02-10

---

## [0.2.9] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- **Header logo/title overlap**: Set explicit `width: 36` and `display: block` on logo image, used numeric gap `16`, and `wrap="nowrap"` on the Group to prevent the title text from bleeding over the logo

### Changed
- **Dashboard layout**: Moved Active Users panel from the bottom row to the top row (spanning 8 columns next to Node Status), displaying users in a compact horizontal layout
- **Report Trends**: Moved from the top row to the bottom row (spanning 8 columns next to Services)

### Removed
- **Environments panel**: Removed from the dashboard

---

## [0.2.8] - 2026-02-10

## [0.2.4] - 2026-02-10

### Changed
- **Login Page**: Replaced placeholder `IconCategory` icon with the official OpenVox fox-V logo (black variant, from [voxpupuli/logos](https://github.com/voxpupuli/logos)) displayed at 72px height on the login card
- **AppShell Header**: Switched from black logo to white variant (`openvox-logo-white.svg`) so the fox-V mark is visible against the dark header background
- **Version strings**: Bumped to v0.2.4 in Login page and AppShell sidebar

### Added
- **`frontend/public/openvox-logo-white.svg`**: White-on-transparent variant of the official OpenVox logo for use on dark backgrounds
- **Official OpenVox Logo**: `frontend/public/openvox-logo.svg` now contains the actual OpenVox fox-V mark by Romain Tartière (CC BY-SA 4.0), replacing the placeholder hexagonal icon

---

## [0.2.3] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- **Duplicate logo in header**: Removed leftover `ThemeIcon` + `IconCategory` that appeared alongside the SVG logo in the AppShell header — now shows only the SVG image
- **Duplicate admin badges**: Consolidated two user badges (one colored, one grey) into a single small grey outline badge showing username and role
- **Empty report logs tab**: Updated backend `get_report_logs()` to query PuppetDB sub-endpoint `/pdb/query/v4/reports/<hash>/logs` directly instead of relying on lazy-loaded href references; changed Puppet `log_level` from `err` to `info` so non-error log entries are captured in reports

---

## [0.2.2] - 2025-02-10

### Added
- **`install.sh`**: Full installer script with 9-step process — service user creation, directory setup, file copying, Python venv, frontend build, configuration generation, systemd service, permissions/firewall/SELinux, and initial admin user setup
  - Supports interactive mode, answer-file (`-c install.conf`), and silent mode (`-y`)
  - Auto-generates secure JWT secret keys and admin passwords
  - Validates sudoers rules with `visudo -cf`
  - Includes `--uninstall` for clean removal
- **`install.conf.example`**: Answer file template with all configurable variables documented
- **`config/.env.example`**: Template environment file (secrets never committed to git)
- **Consolidated sudoers rules** (`/etc/sudoers.d/openvox-gui`): Single file covering r10k deploy, PuppetDB config reading, and Puppet service management (start/stop/restart/status for puppetserver, puppetdb, puppet)

### Changed
- **`config/openvox-gui.service`**: Updated systemd unit file with correct security settings:
  - `NoNewPrivileges=false` — required for `sudo r10k` to work from child processes
  - `PrivateTmp=false` — r10k needs real `/tmp` for module extraction during deployment
  - `ReadWritePaths` expanded to include `/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/cache` (r10k git cache), `/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments` (code deployment target), and `/tmp`
  - Removed `ReadOnlyPaths=/etc/puppetlabs` which blocked r10k code deployment
  - Added `EnvironmentFile` directive pointing to `config/.env`
  - Uses `INSTALL_DIR` placeholder for portability
- **`scripts/deploy.sh`**: Rewritten as a quick re-deploy helper (git pull, pip install, npm build, fix permissions, restart) — for fresh installs use `install.sh` instead
- **`.gitignore`**: Added `config/.env`, `config/.credentials`, and `install.conf` to prevent committing site-specific secrets

### Fixed
- **r10k deployment failure**: `ProtectSystem=strict` with `ReadOnlyPaths=/opt/puppetlabs` made the entire Puppet directory tree read-only in the systemd mount namespace — even `sudo` couldn't write. r10k failed with "Read-only file system" when trying to update `FETCH_HEAD` in its git cache or extract modules to `/tmp`
- **Missing sudoers rule for r10k**: No sudoers entry existed for the puppet user to run `r10k deploy` via sudo
- **Frontend dist/ permissions**: Directory was `750` (puppet:puppet) preventing proper file serving; installer now ensures `755` for dirs and `644` for files in dist/

## [0.2.1] - 2025-02-09

### Added
- **Login Page**: Branded sign-in page with OpenVox icon, gradient background, username/password form, and error handling (`frontend/src/pages/Login.tsx`)
- **Auth Context**: React context for authentication state management — handles login, logout, token persistence in localStorage, and automatic token validation on app load (`frontend/src/hooks/AuthContext.tsx`)
- **OpenVox Logo**: SVG logo file served from the `public/` directory, displayed on both the login page and the app header (`frontend/public/openvox-logo.svg`)
- **User Display in Header**: Logged-in username shown as a badge with role indicator and a sign-out button in the AppShell header
- **API Auth Headers**: All API calls now include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header from stored JWT token (`frontend/src/services/api.ts`)
- **401 Auto-Redirect**: API client automatically clears expired tokens and reloads to show the login page on 401 responses
- **Auth Status Check**: On app load, checks `/api/auth/status` to determine if authentication is required; auto-authenticates when `AUTH_BACKEND=none`

### Changed
- `frontend/src/App.tsx` — Wrapped all routes in `<AuthProvider>`, renders `<LoginPage>` when unauthenticated instead of directly showing the dashboard
- `frontend/src/components/AppShell.tsx` — Added user badge, role display, sign-out button, and OpenVox logo to the header; uses `useAuth()` hook
- `frontend/src/services/api.ts` — Added `getAuthHeaders()` function; all `fetchJSON()` calls now include JWT auth headers; 401 responses trigger automatic logout

### Fixed
- Application was unusable with `AUTH_BACKEND=local` because no login page existed — all API calls returned 401 with no way to authenticate
- Frontend `dist/` directory permissions were too restrictive (`750`), preventing proper file serving

## [0.2.0] - 2025-02-09

### Added
- **Active User Sessions**: Track logged-in users with a 15-minute activity threshold, displayed on the dashboard (`backend/app/models/session.py`, `backend/app/services/auth_local.py`)

  - Events tab: Resource-level changes with type, title, property, old/new values, file, and line number
  - Logs tab: Full Puppet agent log output with severity-level filtering
  - Metrics tab: Complete timing breakdown and resource count summary

  - Deploy all environments or target a specific one
  - Repository discovery from r10k.yaml configuration
  - Real-time deployment output and exit codes
- **Deploy API**: `GET /api/deploy/environments`, `GET /api/deploy/repos`, `GET /api/deploy/status`, `POST /api/deploy/run`
- **Dashboard Active Sessions Widget**: `GET /api/dashboard/active-sessions` endpoint showing current active user count

### Changed
- Reports page rows are now clickable, navigating to `/reports/:hash` for detail view
- Node.js upgraded from v16 to v18 for frontend builds
- Dashboard services monitoring expanded
